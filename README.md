# random_quote_generator-v1
This code generates a quote randomly selected from an array of 5 curated quotes. Each quote has its own source, citation, year, and tags. The button randomly selects a quote again and changes the background. An auto refresh was included to randomly select a quote every 10 seconds if the button is not pressed.
